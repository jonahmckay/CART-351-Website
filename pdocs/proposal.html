    <h1>Files over Ocean Protocol</h1>
    <h3>Jonah McKay's Project Proposal</h3>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <div class="textBlock">
    <p>A collection of messages to no one in particular, File over Ocean Protocol (FTPO) is an exploration of how online communication meets the physical world in the form of an unconventional archive and communication. Participants submit files to a database. At a certain date, the files are loaded onto a USB key or some other physical medium, put in a bottle, and chucked into the sea. After that point, the complete files exist only in the bottle, potentially found at a later date. An index of descriptions along with file names given by the uploaders will persist on the website, as a way to see what people sent out as a “shadow” of the full archive in the form of metadata. Online communication is a mixed bag, and often online communities and spaces can feel fleeting and impersonal. File over Ocean Protocol seeks to confront that by being persistent and personalized. It will be persistent in that it will in most likeliness end up being in a constant state of waiting to be found, and personalized as the meaningfulness of the message will be determined by the participants. The project also has an asymmetry of virtuality, between the distant senders and the hypothetical beachcomber stumbling on the device. While a message in a bottle may seem like an odd choice to examine online community, I think that the two share enough characteristics including anonymity and uncertainty that they have more commonalities than differences. The website will also be presented as if it were using a new communication protocol with the bottle as a networking packet, not unlike some existing parodic technical specifications including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers">IP over Avian Carriers</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/418">HTTP errors for teapots.</a></p>

    <p>By making important the means and method of communication, File over Ocean Protocol encourages participants to reflect on the what and why of their sending. People have sent bottled messages for numerous different reasons, from finding pen pals to propaganda. By prompting participants to seriously consider what they send as well as what they’re sending it on, FTPO will hopefully cause participants to reflect as they make the decisions of what to write. The publicly available file index will also be another way for people to explore the space through seeing what people chose to send. The presence of the bottle as a physical, tangible object may make reflecting on these communications may make the participants’ reflection different than if the communication they were engaging in were entirely virtual.</p>
    <p>In terms of empowerment, the project’s aim is mostly introspective. Sending a message “out there” could be cathartic not because there’s someone at the other end, but because having the potential to elaborate on something can help someone see something in a new light. Also, having the opportunity to participate in a unique form of communication and archiving, as well as getting a glimpse through the index into how other people used that opportunity will allow participants to see from other people’s perspectives. The user will also be encouraged to create their own file specifically to be sent and then delete it on their computer afterwards to make it uniquely on the bottle, although it won’t be verified. This means that they’ll be able to reflect while creating something unique. To streamline the process, a text box will be on the website to let people make text files on the website itself rather than having to do so on Notepad or some other similar program, and there is also the potential to do the same for audio.</p>

    <h4>Kind Words</h4>

    <div class="textBlock">
    <p>Kind Words is a video game where players are asked to send and respond to messages sent by other players. The messages are personal and anonymous. The bulk of the game’s content is in the message sending, along with the relaxed aesthetic of the art and music. The game’s premise is on creating individual communication in a more intimate, relaxed setting than most video games. The developer’s goal with Kind Words was to create a game that encouraged mutual connection and understanding, while allowing for privacy and low stakes. While sending messages with personally identifying information is discouraged, the messages people send range from casual, like asking for music recommendations, to serious, asking for support with interpersonal issues and depression. Ziba Scott, one of the developers for Kind Words, said in a Polygon interview that one of the key issues for Kind Words was making sure “…every word someone writes [has] an appreciative audience”. Scott compared Kind Words to another game he worked on with player-written messages, Elegy for a Dead World. In that game however, player messages were less well received, as they were “short stories and poems” and players didn’t want to “go through a bunch of amateur writing”. The solution was to make the writing in Kind Words personal rather than impersonal. Kind Words also strives to encourage empathy between the users as a response to the contemporary political climate in 2019, saying that while games responding directly to those topics would be “preaching to the choir”, Kind Words’ more general message may resonate with more people.</p>

    <h4>COVID Time Capsule</h4>

    <div class="textBlock">
    <p>The Department of Imaginary Affairs is a non-profit focused on “telling the stories of new and developing Canadians”, meaning people who have either immigrated to Canada or are youth in Canada.  The COVID-19 Time Capsule is part of this goal, encouraging participants to write letters to their future self, prompting them with a guided meditation on reflecting on how COVID-19 has affected them. After the pandemic is over, the letter will be e-mailed back to them. The full time capsule, with all the letters sent will also be made available. The goal is to encourage introspection on how the pandemic has affected the world, along with getting people to tell their personal story during these times. A large part of the COVID Time Capsule is highlighting how the Internet can empower people to communicate even while socially distanced. </p>

    <h4>Dead Drops</h4>

    <div class="textBlock">
    <p>A mix of street art and hacker culture, Dead Drops is a project by artist Aram Bartholl consisting of a website, a text manifesto, and numerous open access USB drives across the world. Described as “an anonymous, offline, peer to peer file-sharing network in public space”, Dead Drops encourages participation both by uploading files to the network, and creating new nodes by installing USB drives and listing them on the website, which has a catalogue of all known dead drops, along with whether they’re confirmed to be still installed or have been lost. Dead Drops is a direct contrast to cloud storage solutions, repositioning public data in physical space.  The Dead Drop Manifesto explains what is and isn’t a Dead Drop, saying that it must be publicly accessible, singular and not networked, and that the most “beautiful” dead drop shows only the metal sheath of a USB mounted into a wall. Dead Drops are considered public domain, with all the complications that brings, including misuse and the potential for malicious software to be installed on the devices. Dead Drops are in a way a more explicitly digital relative of the geocache, relying on the goodwill of others to maintain themselves and pass on the experience. Unfortunately, most Dead Drops on the website are listed as “broken/dead/stolen/gone”.</p>

    <p>File over Ocean Protocol and these projects share certain themes, including data in physical spaces and considered communication. Using a physical message in a bottle brings an element of uncertainty to the message’s recipient, as well as bringing into question whether it will be received at all. One thing that differentiates this project from the others mentioned is being able to easily send a message transported by physical means entirely through a website. By equating the message in a bottle to a networking packet, the project breaks down not only the idea that what goes on online stays online, but that the very infrastructure of the Internet itself is itself physical even if it has the appearance of being disconnected.</p>
